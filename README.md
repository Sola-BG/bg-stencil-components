# BG Stencil Components

This is a proof of concept project for building a standalone Web Component using Stencil.

Stencil is also great for building entire apps. For that, use the [stencil-app-starter](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-app-starter) instead.


## Using this component

Example usage for `bg-stencil-button` component:-
~~~~
<bg-stencil-button id="myBgButton" text=">Do NOT Click Me!" classname="btn btn-primary" onclick="onClickHandler(this);">
</bg-stencil-button>
~~~~
